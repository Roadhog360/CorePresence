### What is this?
Grabs your current game info from logs and displays it in Rich Presense (may be a bit slow/not always accurate)

__It is currently only for the PC version of the game!__

CorePresence utilizes log tracking to keep track of the state of the game and display it as your Discord status!

It can also show information like current Arena, selected Striker, match score and what phase of the game you are in. The underscores represent set points, where the `x` is a won set, and the number next to it is how many points that team earned during the set. Similar to the game, your score is on the left and th enemy's is on the right.

### How do I use it?
- Be sure you have Java installed on your computer. At least Java 8 is required.
- You can then simply run the jar with Java
- To open the jar with logging, open PowerShell, CMD or your preferred terminal. Make sure it is in the same directory the jar is in, then type `java -jar <jarname>.jar`. Where `<jarname>` should be replaced with the jar's name (Example: `CorePresence-alpha2.jar`)
- Open Omega Strikers on your PC, then simply set your Discord game status to "`Omega Strikers CorePresence`".

### Report an issue / Suggest a feature
Issue reports go [here](https://github.com/Roadhog360/CorePresence/issues) and suggestions go [here](https://github.com/Roadhog360/CorePresence/discussions).
Issue reports or suggestions can also go in Discord if you want, either via `roadhog360` on Discord or in the forum in the server you found it in.

Psst! If you are an Omega Strikers developer, please read my wishlist [here](https://github.com/Roadhog360/CorePresence/discussions/2)! CorePresense works from log tracking, so the addition of simple log messages would make things much easier for me and make log tracking far more reliable in some areas!
