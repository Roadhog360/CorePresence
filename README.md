# Hello!
I'm Rasmus, and today I'm enthralled to show us our latest creation straight from the labs of Clarion Corp; CorePresence! 

### What is this?
CorePresense is a revolutionary invention by Nao, invented to proudly show off your current match information! Other Strikers who have Discord downloaded may see the game information displayed right on your profile for all to see!
Our new product operates by simply reading the log file of the game from Steam to collect information about your Striking endeavors.

__It is currently only for the PC version of the game!__

Not sold on it yet? Take a look for yourself! Here's how our captivating new technology will look on your Discord profile:

It can also show information like current Arena, selected Striker, match score and what phase of the game you are in. The underscores represent set points, where the `x` is a won set, and the number next to it is how many points that team earned during the set. Similar to the game, your score is on the left and the enemy's is on the right.

### How do I use it?
- Be sure you have Java installed on your computer. At least Java 8 is required.
- You can then simply run the jar with Java
- To open the jar with logging, open PowerShell, CMD or your preferred terminal. Make sure it is in the same directory the jar is in, then type `java -jar <jarname>.jar`. Where `<jarname>` should be replaced with the jar's name (Example: `CorePresence-alpha2.jar`)
- Open Omega Strikers on your PC, then simply set your Discord game status to "`Omega Strikers CorePresence`". You should only have to do this when opening it for the first time, after it will work automatically.

### Report an issue / Suggest a feature
Issue reports go [here](https://github.com/Roadhog360/CorePresence/issues) and suggestions go [here](https://github.com/Roadhog360/CorePresence/discussions).
Issue reports or suggestions can also go in Discord if you want, either via `roadhog360` on Discord or in the forum in the server you found it in.

That's all for now! We hope that you are as excited about this incredible new technology as we are! We at Clarion Corp will be sure to keep this page updated as the simple little applet continues to evolve and change! 

Psst! If you are an Omega Strikers developer, please read my wishlist [here](https://github.com/Roadhog360/CorePresence/discussions/2)! CorePresense works from log tracking, so the addition of simple log messages would make things much easier for me and make log tracking far more reliable in some areas!
